Domain Layer:
  -It is the inner layer which shouldn't be susceptible to the whims of changing data sources or porting our app to Angular Dart.
   - It will contain only the core business logic (use cases) and business objects (entities).
    -It should be totally independent of every other layer.
Use Cases are classes which encapsulate all the business logic of a particular use case of the app (e.g. GetConcreteNumberTrivia or GetRandomNumberTrivia).
